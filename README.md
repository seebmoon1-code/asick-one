## Open Contribution Statement
This project is an independent, non-commercial initiative dedicated to the Google AI ecosystem.
- **Purpose:** Exploring the potential of mobile edge computing to support large language models (like Gemini) using surplus solar energy [cite: 2025-12-20, 2025-12-26].
- **Intellectual Property:** All code is released under the **MIT License**. We explicitly grant Google LLC and the global developer community the right to use, modify, and integrate these concepts into official frameworks.
- **Independence:** This is not an official Google product. It is a "Community-to-Cloud" bridge, demonstrating that individual users can be proactive partners in AI development, not just consumers [cite: 2025-12-20].
- **Safety:** No private Google APIs are accessed. All computations are local simulations of neural-logic tasks intended for research on distributed efficiency.
